This will be a translator for the word hello,
it will basically prompt the user to choose a language
unfortunately I didn't put all the languages known to mankind
I just used most the common ones like German, English, Spanish, Bulgarian, Japanese
and a few others. I feel like this could work in multiple platforms accross the 
world and could potentially become a dictionary/ translation app of some sort...
like there isn't enough of those out there already... haha, but basically
this is just a small project I thought would be cool to write out as my first of many
ruby projects!
Enjoy!
